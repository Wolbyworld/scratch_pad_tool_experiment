# Scratch Pad AI Tool Project

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal**: Create an AI tool called "Scratch Pad" that processes user queries by loading and analyzing a local scratch pad document (.txt file) to provide relevant contextual responses.

**Core Functionality**:
- Input: User query
- Process: Load and analyze scratch pad document from same folder
- Output: Relevant context to respond to the query
- AI Model: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

**Scratch Pad Document Structure**:
- Section on media documents that have been processed (file path, description)
  - Focus: Images (PNG) and PDFs initially
- Section of relevant user facts (age, preferences, current projects, etc.)
- Template-based structure for consistency

**Technical Specifications**:
- Implementation: Python with OpenAI SDK
- Model: GPT-4o-mini or o4-mini (latest available)
- Interface: CLI tool for concept testing + **NEW: Web interface**
- Configuration: .env file for API key management
- System prompt: Easily editable for customization

**Use Case**: This tool will help users quickly find relevant information from their personal knowledge base stored in a structured text file, using AI to intelligently extract and present the most pertinent context for their specific queries.

**NEW: Web Interface Added**: Simple ChatGPT-style web interface with editable scratchpad sidebar for enhanced user experience.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### 1. Scratch Pad Document Design
**Challenge**: Create a standardized, AI-parseable template that balances human readability with machine processing efficiency.

**Considerations**:
- Should use clear section markers for consistent parsing
- Need flexible structure to accommodate various types of media and facts
- Must be easy for users to maintain and update manually

### 2. Context Relevance and Retrieval
**Challenge**: Intelligently identify which parts of the scratch pad are most relevant to user queries.

**Considerations**:
- Simple keyword matching vs. semantic similarity
- How to handle queries that span multiple sections
- Balancing context size vs. relevance (GPT token limits)

### 3. Tool Interface and Usability
**Challenge**: Design an intuitive interface that fits into users' workflows.

**Options to evaluate**:
- CLI tool for terminal users
- Simple web interface for broader accessibility
- Integration possibilities (VS Code extension, etc.)

### 4. AI Integration Architecture
**Challenge**: Efficiently integrate OpenAI API while managing costs and response times.

**Latest SDK Information** (from research):
- Standard OpenAI Python SDK is current best practice
- GPT-4o-mini: ~$1.16/M input tokens, $4.62/M output tokens
- Newer o4-mini available: ~$1.10/M input tokens, $4.40/M output tokens
- Both support multimodal inputs (text + images)

**Enhanced Media Processing Requirements**:
- Model must determine: (a) whether media file(s) are necessary for the query
- Model must determine: (b) whether text summary/captioning is sufficient or another vision call is needed
- Two-stage approach: initial assessment, then detailed analysis if required

**Implementation Decisions** (based on user feedback):
- Use .env file for secure API key storage
- System prompt stored in easily editable location
- Simple approach: pass entire scratch pad to AI for context extraction
- Intelligent media handling with dual-stage processing
- Project structure includes dedicated `media/` folder

### 5. File Management and Organization
**Challenge**: Handle file discovery, loading, and potential multiple scratch pad files.

**Considerations**:
- Single vs. multiple scratch pad files
- File naming conventions
- Backup and versioning strategies

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation and Design
**Task 1.1**: Create Scratch Pad Template

- **Success Criteria**: Continuous chat with scratch pad context integration

**Task 2.3**: Add Media Processing Integration
- Link scratch pad media recommendations to media analysis
- Handle image files and add visual analysis to conversation context
- Implement smart media processing workflow
- **Success Criteria**: Media files automatically processed when scratch pad indicates necessity

### Phase 3: Chat Experience Polish

- **Success Criteria**: Natural conversations with reliable context enrichment

### Phase 5: Dynamic Scratchpad Updating

#### New Requirements Analysis

**Core Concept**: Implement intelligent scratchpad updating that learns from conversations and keeps personal knowledge current.

**Input Data Available**:
- Last user prompt
- AI completion/response  
- Function tools called (get_scratch_pad_context, analyze_media_file)
- Tool responses and context
- Current scratchpad content

**Key Design Questions to Resolve**:

1. **Trigger Strategy**: When should updates happen?
   - After every conversation turn?
   - When specific information types are detected?
   - Periodically (e.g., at end of session)?
   - User-initiated command?

2. **Information Classification**: What should be stored vs. ephemeral?
   - New facts about user (permanent info like address changes)
   - Preferences discovered during conversation
   - Project updates and progress
   - Temporary interests vs. lasting preferences
   - Corrections to existing information

3. **Conflict Resolution**: How to handle contradictory information?
   - New info contradicts existing (update vs. flag for review)
   - Temporary vs. permanent changes
   - User explicitly corrects vs. casual mention

4. **Quality Control**: How to avoid information bloat?
   - Relevance scoring for what's worth storing
   - Automatic cleanup of outdated information
   - Summarization of related facts

5. **Technical Integration**: How to implement with current architecture?
   - New function tool for GPT-4.1 to call?
   - Background process analyzing conversation logs?
   - Separate update service vs. integrated into Luzia?

6. **User Control**: How much user involvement?
   - Automatic updates vs. user approval required
   - Ability to review and reject suggested updates
   - Manual override capabilities

#### Proposed Architecture Options

**Option A: Function Tool Approach**
- New `update_scratchpad(analysis: str, proposed_changes: list)` function
- Called by GPT-4.1 when significant information detected
- Real-time updates during conversation

**Option B: Session Summary Approach**  
- Analyze entire conversation at end of session
- Batch processing of all learned information
- User review before applying changes

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Real-time flagging of potential updates
- Batch processing and user review at session end
- Critical updates (corrections) applied immediately

#### Information Types to Track

**Personal Facts**: DOB, address, job changes, family updates
**Preferences**: Food, entertainment, tools, working styles  
**Projects**: Current work, goals, progress updates, completed items
**Media**: New files discussed, updated descriptions
**Relationships**: People mentioned, context about connections
**Learning**: New skills acquired, interests developed

#### Technical Considerations

**Privacy**: Sensitive information filtering and user consent
**Performance**: Efficient analysis without slowing conversation
**Reliability**: Backup and rollback capabilities for bad updates
**Scalability**: Handle growing scratchpad size over time
