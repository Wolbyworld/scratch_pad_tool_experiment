The document provides a detailed analysis of Didi's strategic entry into the Brazilian food delivery market, aiming to challenge dominant players like iFood and preempt competitors like Meituan. Didi relaunched its service as 99Food in mid-2025 after an initial attempt between 2019-2021. The pilot phase started in Goiânia, chosen for its diversity, with plans to expand rapidly into larger cities such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro once the pilot proves successful. Didi's primary motivation appears to be countering Meituan's impending entry, as well as capturing market share from iFood, which currently dominates a fast-growing online food delivery sector valued at R$139 billion and expanding at 15-20% annually in Brazil.

Didi has allocated approximately R$1 billion for its Brazilian expansion, leveraging its existing ride-hailing platform (99) to support its food delivery service. The entry includes competitive strategies such as zero-commission offers to attract restaurants, promotional campaigns, and leveraging its large fleet of delivery couriers, including ride-hailing drivers. Didi's approach also aims to improve delivery speed and coverage, especially in smaller or underserved cities, by using its extensive network and advanced AI dispatch algorithms.

The rivalry extends beyond competition with iFood—Didi is also directly aiming to block Meituan, which plans to invest R$5 billion (# 【0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10†sources】). Public sentiment in Brazil towards this competition remains cautiously optimistic, with consumers benefiting from promotions and discounts but also concerned about service quality, delivery times, and the treatment of couriers. Both companies are innovating in customer experience; iFood is developing an AI assistant, Luzia, to enhance personalization, support, and engagement, aiming to differentiate through experience and technology, while Didi's entry intensifies the competitive landscape of the sector【0,6†source】.
