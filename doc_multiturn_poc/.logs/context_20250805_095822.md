The document outlines Didi's strategic plan to re-enter Brazil's food delivery market in mid-2025 with its 99Food brand. After an earlier unsuccessful attempt (2019-2021), Didi returns better equipped with significant capital, improved strategies, and technological advancements. The initial launch is planned for Goiânia, chosen for its demographic diversity, with intentions to expand to major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Didi aims to challenge the current market leader iFood and preempt competition from the Chinese company Meituan (operating as "Keeta"). The company focuses on a flexible operational model that integrates ride-hailing and food delivery logistics, uses electric scooters for efficiency, and incorporates its fintech platform 99Pay for seamless transactions.

The market competition is intensifying, with iFood responding through strategic partnerships such as with Uber. Public reaction is mixed, with optimism about competition but concerns over labor practices during initial operations. Didi plans aggressive promotions, zero-commission offers to onboard restaurants quickly, and aims to create a super-app ecosystem combining food delivery, ride-hailing, and financial services to compete strongly against iFood's dominance.
