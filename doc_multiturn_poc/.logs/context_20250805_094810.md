The document provides a comprehensive overview of Didi’s strategic entry into the Brazilian food delivery market, primarily through the relaunch of its 99Food service in mid-2025. Didi’s approach was characterized by careful market testing, starting in Goiânia, with plans to expand rapidly into larger cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro once operational stability was confirmed. The company's entry is motivated by both competitive pressures—particularly to preempt Meituan’s entry—and the lucrative growth potential of Brazil’s fast-growing, but still emerging, food delivery sector valued at approximately R$139 billion in mid-2025.

Didi’s strategy emphasizes a disruptive, subsidy-driven model, offering zero commission to restaurants, promoting a flexible delivery ecosystem with integrated ride-hailing and digital payment services via its 99Pay platform, and leveraging advanced AI tools to optimize logistics and demand prediction. Challenges have arisen with the courier model, especially concerning payment issues with third-party logistics providers, but Didi aims to refine these operational models for scale.

The entry has sparked a highly competitive “war of the apps,” with established players like iFood responding through strategic partnerships, loyalty programs, and promotional offers to retain market share. Public perception of Didi’s move has been mixed, with initial positive reactions from consumers attracted by lower prices and free delivery, contrasted with some logistical frustrations and dissatisfaction expressed about the initial service quality.

Overall, Didi aims to establish a dominant, multi-service super-app ecosystem by harnessing its technological infrastructure, strategic local partnerships, and aggressive pricing tactics to challenge the entrenched market leader, iFood, and reshape the competitive landscape in Brazil’s food delivery sector .
