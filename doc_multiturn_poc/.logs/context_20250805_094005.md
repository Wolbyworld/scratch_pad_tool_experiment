The PDF document analyzes Didi's strategic entry into the Brazilian food delivery market with its service 99Food, relaunched in mid-2025 after an initial attempt between 2019-2021. The pilot began in Goiânia, chosen for its diversity, with plans to expand to major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Didi aims to challenge the dominant player iFood and preempt competitor Meituan, which plans a significant investment in Brazil.

Didi has allocated around R$1 billion for this expansion, leveraging its existing ride-hailing platform to support food delivery with strategies such as zero commissions for restaurants, promotional campaigns, and utilizing its large fleet of delivery couriers. The company focuses on improving delivery speed and coverage, especially in smaller or underserved cities, using its extensive network and AI dispatch algorithms.

The competition is intense, with iFood investing in AI innovations like the assistant Luzia to enhance customer experience and engagement. Public sentiment is mixed, with consumers benefiting from promotions but concerned about service quality and courier treatment. Overall, Didi's entry intensifies competition in Brazil's fast-growing food delivery market valued at R$139 billion and expanding at 15-20% annually.
