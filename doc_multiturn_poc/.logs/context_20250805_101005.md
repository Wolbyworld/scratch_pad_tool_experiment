The document provides an in-depth overview of Didi's strategic entry into the Brazilian food delivery market, primarily through its platform 99Food. Didi adopts a disruptive approach by offering aggressive pricing tactics, such as waiving all commissions and monthly fees for restaurants for 24 months in its relaunch, which significantly undermines the existing models of competitors like iFood. This move allows restaurants to retain nearly the entire order value, transforming delivery into a profitable venture for them and potentially lowering costs for consumers .

Didi's strategy involves phased rollout across Brazil, leveraging its extensive network of over 700,000 active drivers, many of whom can serve multiple purposes—including passenger transport, goods delivery, and food delivery—maximizing operational efficiency. The company also integrates its financial services, notably 99Pay, to streamline payments and foster a super-app ecosystem combining ride-hailing, food delivery, and financial services .

To attract restaurants, Didi uses partnerships with associations, grassroots campaigns, and incentives like free delivery and coupons to quickly build market share. Its flexible fulfillment models—Full Service and Marketplace—provide restaurants with choices that differ from iFood’s full-service approach, appealing especially to those who want control over their delivery process .

On the consumer side, Didi deploys heavy incentives, including discounted or free delivery, to boost early adoption, while also leveraging AI-driven logistics and demand prediction to optimize delivery times and costs. The company also plans to enhance user engagement through AI-powered chat assistants like Luzia, which can provide personalized recommendations, real-time support, and seamless interactions via popular messaging platforms such as WhatsApp   .

Public sentiment in Brazil is cautiously optimistic, with consumers welcoming lower prices and increased choices but also cautious about service quality and coverage. Didi's entry has accelerated the price war, prompting established players like iFood to respond with their own discounts and loyalty programs, thereby heightening the competitive landscape  .

Overall, Didi’s approach combines substantial financial incentives, technological innovation, extensive logistics infrastructure, and strategic partnerships to challenge iFood’s dominance and gain a foothold in Brazil’s rapidly evolving food delivery sector .
