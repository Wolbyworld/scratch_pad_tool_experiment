The document provides a comprehensive overview of Didi's strategic re-entry into Brazil's food delivery market with its 99Food brand, starting in mid-2025. After a previous, short-lived attempt from 2019-2021, Didi returned better prepared, leveraging significant capital, refined strategies, and technological enhancements. The initial launch was in Goiânia, a city chosen for its demographic diversity, with plans for rapid expansion into larger markets like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro once the pilot proves successful. 

Didi's motivations include challenging dominant player iFood, preempting the entry of Chinese competitor Meituan (under "Keeta"), and capturing a share of Brazil's rapidly growing food delivery market, valued at R$139 billion in mid-2025. Didi's approach involves a flexible operational model for restaurants, integrating ride-hailing and food delivery logistics, utilizing electric scooters to improve efficiency, and linking its fintech platform, 99Pay, for seamless transactions. 

The competition is intensifying, with iFood responding through strategic partnerships such as the Uber-iFood alliance, and Didi's entry has sparked significant media coverage and public interest. Public sentiment is mixed, with optimism about increased competition but concern over labor practices, notably the issues with courier payments during pilot operations. 

Didi's expansion strategy emphasizes rapid onboarding of restaurants via zero-commission offers and aggressive promotions to attract users, while also addressing operational challenges related to logistics and labor relations. The company's goal is to build a super-app ecosystem encompassing food delivery, ride-hailing, and integrated financial services, positioning itself as a formidable contender to iFood's dominance【0:0, 0:2, 0:3, 0:4, 0:5, 0:6, 0:7, 0:8, 0:9, 0:11, 0:12, 0:14, 0:15, 0:16, 0:17, 0:18】.
