According to the document, the main causes of mortality in Brazil are not explicitly detailed within the provided snippets. However, the overall context suggests that the document primarily discusses the food delivery market and competition among delivery platforms rather than health or mortality statistics. Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot determine the main cause of mortality in Brazil from this document.

### Message 3 (Assistant)
