Didi's main strategies as outlined in the 2023 Annual Report focus on a comprehensive and integrated approach to its business operations, emphasizing several core elements:

1. **"One platform, many services" approach**: Didi aims to unify various services—ridesharing, food delivery, parcel delivery—within a single app and network, maximizing driver productivity by allowing riders to switch between tasks seamlessly based on demand and opportunity.

2. **Technology and AI-driven logistics**: Didi leverages advanced AI tools, including demand prediction and route optimization, to enhance delivery efficiency, reduce costs, and improve urban logistics. The company is also encouraging the use of electric vehicles in its fleet to lower fuel costs and enhance sustainability.

3. **Flexible restaurant fulfillment models**: 99Food offers restaurants two modes—Full Service (where Didi handles delivery) and Marketplace (where restaurants use their own couriers)—allowing flexibility and catering to different operational preferences, thus attracting a broader range of restaurant partners.

4. **Aggressive pricing and subsidy strategies**: Didi has implemented a zero-commission policy for restaurants for the first two years to attract new clients and build market share rapidly. It also uses discounts and coupons for consumers to stimulate demand and acquire users quickly.

5. **Integration of financial services**: The company integrates its payment platform (99Pay) with food delivery operations, creating a seamless payment experience and positioning itself as part of Brazil’s broader digital commerce ecosystem.

6. **Local partnerships and expansion**: Didi strategically partners with restaurant associations, local courier companies, and government bodies to facilitate rapid expansion in Brazil’s diverse markets, including underserved rural and smaller urban areas.

7. **Talent acquisition and competitive positioning**: Didi invests in hiring and retaining top talent, including executives with local market expertise and technical specialists, and it actively competes with established players like iFood for skilled workers.

8. **Market disruption and competitive strategy**: Didi’s entry is characterized by subsidizing prices, disrupting existing fee structures, and expanding into underserved markets to challenge iFood’s dominance and pre-empt competitors such as Meituan.

These strategies collectively aim to establish Didi as a formidable multi-service super-app in Brazil, leveraging technology, aggressive market entry tactics, and local partnerships to compete effectively in the evolving food delivery landscape【5:0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6†didi.pdf】.
