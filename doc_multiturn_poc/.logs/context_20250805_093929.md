The document outlines Didi's aggressive strategy with its brand 99Food to enter and disrupt the Brazilian food delivery market, challenging established players like iFood. 99Food offers a zero-commission model for restaurants for 24 months, significantly lowering their costs and allowing them to keep more revenue. To attract consumers, 99Food provides discounts, free delivery, and coupons. The company also forms partnerships with restaurant associations, uses AI-driven logistics, and invests in infrastructure such as the 99Pay digital payment system.

iFood retains advantages through a larger restaurant network, strong loyalty programs, and brand recognition but faces new competition due to regulatory changes that ended exclusivity agreements with major chains. This change has enabled new entrants like 99Food and Rappi to offer subsidies and zero-fee promotions. The market competition is intense, focusing on app experience, speed, customer support, and loyalty incentives, resulting in a "war of the apps" with high customer acquisition costs and heavy promotional efforts.

The uploaded document does not contain information regarding the main causes of mortality in Brazil. However, based on general knowledge, the main causes of mortality in Brazil typically include cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, followed by respiratory diseases, cancers, and external causes like traffic accidents and violence. If you need detailed or specific data, I can provide information from other reliable sources.
