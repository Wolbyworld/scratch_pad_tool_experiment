Didi's 99Food is considered a threat to iFood in the Brazilian food delivery market primarily due to its aggressive pricing and user acquisition strategies, which undermine iFood's traditional business model. One of the most significant tactics is the waiving of all commission and monthly fees for restaurants for an extended period—specifically, a 24-month guarantee starting upon signing up. This policy allows restaurants to keep almost the entire order value, significantly increasing their profitability from delivery and enabling them to charge consumer prices comparable to in-restaurant dining. This shifts the market dynamic by offering restaurants a more attractive financial incentive than iFood, which typically charges commissions ranging from 12% to 27%, thus cutting into restaurant profits and often leading to higher menu prices for consumers.

On the consumer side, Didi is deploying heavy incentives such as free delivery and large coupons, which lower barriers to trying the platform and attract price-sensitive customers. These promotional strategies, combined with the fact that 99Food is bringing many new restaurants—including those not previously on other apps—further diversify the options available to consumers. The result is increased competition for market share, with the added advantage of lower costs for consumers and higher margins for restaurants, which could erode iFood’s dominant position.

Moreover, Didi’s vast existing driver network across Brazil, which operates in over 3,300 cities and towns, offers an advantage in rapidly scaling delivery capacity, especially in underserved secondary cities and suburbs where iFood's coverage is thinner. This extensive coverage allows Didi to reach a broad user base immediately and leverage its logistic infrastructure to quickly expand operations.

Overall, Didi's strategic combination of zero-commission policies, aggressive promotions, technological integration, and extensive logistics infrastructure makes it a formidable competitor that could threaten iFood’s market leadership in Brazil.

Didi's 99Food is considered a significant threat to iFood for several detailed reasons:

1. **Zero-Commission Policy for Restaurants:** Didi offers restaurants a 24-month guarantee of zero commissions and no monthly fees upon signing up. This means restaurants keep almost the entire order value, improving their profitability compared to iFood, which charges commissions ranging from 12% to 27%. This financial incentive makes 99Food more attractive to restaurants and allows them to offer prices closer to in-restaurant dining, changing the market dynamics.

2. **Aggressive Consumer Incentives:** To attract users, 99Food provides heavy promotions such as free delivery and large coupons. These reduce the cost for consumers to try the platform and help quickly build a user base.

3. **New Restaurant Listings:** 99Food is onboarding many restaurants that were not previously available on other delivery apps, increasing options for consumers and expanding market reach.

4. **Extensive Logistics Network:** Didi already operates in over 3,300 cities and towns in Brazil with a large driver network. This allows rapid scaling of delivery capacity, especially in secondary cities and suburbs where iFood has less presence.

5. **Technological Integration:** Didi integrates ride-hailing, food delivery, and fintech services (via 99Pay), creating a super-app ecosystem that can offer seamless and efficient user experiences.

Together, these strategies give Didi a competitive edge by lowering costs for both restaurants and consumers, expanding service coverage, and leveraging technological synergies, all of which challenge iFood’s dominance in the Brazilian food delivery market.
