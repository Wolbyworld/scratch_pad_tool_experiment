The documents describe the aggressive strategic push by Didi's brand 99Food into the Brazilian food delivery market, directly challenging incumbents like iFood. 99Food has implemented a zero-commission model for restaurants, waiving fees for 24 months, which significantly reduces restaurant costs and enables them to retain more order value. This strategy is complemented by extensive consumer incentives like discounts, free delivery, and coupons to quickly attract users and build market share. Didi's approach involves forming partnerships with restaurant associations, leveraging AI-driven logistics, and investing in infrastructure like the 99Pay digital payment system. 

Meanwhile, iFood maintains a competitive edge through its larger restaurant base, sophisticated loyalty programs, and established brand recognition. However, it faces pressure from regulatory changes that have ended exclusivity agreements with major chains, opening the market for new entrants like 99Food and Rappi, who are responding with their own subsidies and zero-fee promotions. Both companies are also competing on app user experience, speed, support, and loyalty incentives, with the overall market experiencing a "war of the apps" characterized by high customer acquisition costs and intense promotional campaigns     .

iFood retains advantages through a larger restaurant network, strong loyalty programs, and brand recognition but faces new competition due to regulatory changes that ended exclusivity agreements with major chains. This change has enabled new entrants like 99Food and Rappi to offer subsidies and zero-fee promotions. The market competition is intense, focusing on app experience, speed, customer support, and loyalty incentives, resulting in a "war of the apps" with high customer acquisition costs and heavy promotional efforts.
