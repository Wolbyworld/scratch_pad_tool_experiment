I don't have access to real-time weather information. You can check the current weather by using a weather website or app like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or a local news station's weather report. If you provide me with your location, I can guide you on where to look!

and what's the main mortality cause in BRazil?
```

### Message 3 (Assistant)

```
The main causes of mortality in Brazil typically include chronic non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke), cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Among these, cardiovascular diseases are generally the leading cause of death. Additionally, external causes such as traffic accidents and violence also contribute significantly to mortality rates in Brazil.

For the most current and detailed statistics, sources like the Brazilian Ministry of Health or the World Health Organization can provide updated information.
