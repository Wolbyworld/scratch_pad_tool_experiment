The uploaded PDF document does not contain information about the main causes of mortality in Barcelona. If you need information on this topic, I can provide a general answer based on existing knowledge or you can provide a specific document related to that subject. Would you like me to proceed with a general explanation?

In Barcelona, as in many developed urban areas, the main causes of mortality typically align with global trends for developed countries. The leading causes of death often include:

1. **Cardiovascular Diseases:** These are the leading cause of death in Barcelona, including heart attacks, strokes, and other heart-related conditions.

2. **Cancer:** Various forms of cancer, such as lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, are major causes of mortality.

3. **Respiratory Diseases:** Chronic respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia contribute significantly.

4. **Neurological Disorders:** Diseases such as Alzheimer's and other dementias are increasingly common causes of death, particularly in older populations.

5. **Accidents and Injuries:** Including traffic accidents and falls.

The public health system in Barcelona and Spain overall actively addresses these issues through preventive care, health promotion, and medical treatment. Specific mortality statistics can vary year to year and are reported by health authorities such as the Catalan Institute of Statistics or the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE).

If you want the most recent and detailed data, consulting official health reports or databases would be advisable.
