The main strategies mentioned in the document for Didi's entry into the Brazilian food delivery market include:

1. **Phased Rollout and Market Entry**: Didi launched initially in a mid-sized city, Goiânia, to test and refine its model before expanding rapidly into larger cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. This phased approach allows them to iron out operational challenges and adapt their strategies as they scale.

2. **Aggressive Pricing and User Acquisition**: Didi is employing aggressive pricing tactics such as waiving all commissions and monthly fees for restaurants for 24 months, which significantly undercuts traditional platforms like iFood. They also use heavy promotions, including free delivery and coupons, to rapidly grow their user base.

3. **Integration of Multiple Services**: Didi’s “one platform, many services” approach enables riders to carry out multiple tasks—transport passengers, deliver goods, and deliver food—simultaneously using the same app and network. This boosts productivity by minimizing idle capacity through smart dispatch algorithms and integrated operations.

4. **Expansion of Delivery Footprint and Technology-Driven Logistics**: Didi leverages its extensive driver network and deploys AI-driven demand prediction and route optimization tools to slash delivery times and costs. They also promote the use of electric two-wheelers to enhance urban logistics efficiency.

5. **Partnerships with Restaurant Associations and Local Logistics Providers**: Didi collaborates with restaurant associations and unions to rapidly onboard a wide range of eateries, including small and medium businesses, leveraging grassroots partnerships instead of one-by-one negotiations. It also partners with local courier companies (Operadoras Logísticas) to quickly increase delivery capacity, though with some operational challenges.

6. **Financial and Regulatory Engagement**: Didi invests in digital payment infrastructure through 99Pay and maintains close relationships with city governments and regulatory bodies to support growth and facilitate smoother operations and regulatory approvals .

7. **Market and Competitive Positioning**: Didi’s entry was strategically timed ahead of other Chinese competitors like Meituan to secure a first-mover advantage in the fast-growing, underpenetrated Brazilian market. Their goal is not only to challenge iFood but also to block Meituan’s potential expansion.

These strategies together form a comprehensive approach to rapidly establish and expand Didi's presence in Brazil’s highly competitive food delivery sector【5:2,5,9†didi.pdf】.
