The main causes of mortality in Brazil typically include chronic non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke), cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Among these, cardiovascular diseases are generally the leading cause of death. Additionally, external causes such as traffic accidents and violence also contribute significantly to mortality rates in Brazil.

For the most current and detailed statistics, sources like the Brazilian Ministry of Health or the World Health Organization can provide updated information.

and is this new company a threat for iFood?

Based on the information in the document, yes, Didi's new food delivery brand 99Food is considered a significant threat to iFood. Didi is entering the market with strong financial backing, advanced technology, and a strategic plan aimed at rapid expansion. They are leveraging innovative logistics like electric scooters, integrating ride-hailing with food delivery, and offering attractive terms to restaurants such as zero commissions initially.

This aggressive approach is designed to capture market share quickly and challenge iFood's dominance. Furthermore, iFood is responding to this competition with strategic partnerships, such as with Uber, indicating that the market perceives Didi's entry as a serious competitive threat.
